# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pace best-effort tools** (read-only, GET only) returning the same numbers as the
  website's Pace tab "Best efforts" and Best Efforts page:
  `get_activity_best_efforts` (standard distances within one activity, from
  `/activity/{id}/pace-curve.json`), `get_best_efforts_bulk` (one distance for every
  activity in a date range, fastest first, fetched in calendar-year chunks from
  `/athlete/{id}/activity-pace-curves.json`), and `get_athlete_best_efforts` (ranked list
  for `all` / `season` / `<N>d` / `<N>y` / a date range; the window comes from
  `/athlete/{id}/pace-curves.json`, and the ranking is cross-checked against it). No
  interpolation: distances off the Intervals.icu ladder are rounded up to the next ladder
  distance, as the website does. `gap=true` for grade-adjusted pace.
- **HTTP 429 backoff** for these calls: Retry-After when given, otherwise 5 s / 10 s /
  20 s, up to 3 retries (abortable).
- **systemd user-service template** (`deploy/intervals-mcp.service`) for HTTP mode.

## [0.12.1] — 2026-07-03

### Documentation

- **Runner-facing onboarding pass** (`README.md` / `README.ja.md`): plain-language
  intro sentence ahead of the technical definition, a dual PMC chart screenshot
  (`docs/images/dual_pmc.jpg`), a "Try it now" section with zero-setup example
  questions, and an "AI-assisted install" pointer promoted to the top of Quick start.
- **`INSTALL.md` / `INSTALL.ja.md`**: removed leftover `LBSS_FIELD_LEGACY` /
  `include_legacy` references (the feature itself was removed in v0.12.0; the docs
  hadn't caught up). Prerequisites reorganized by install path so MCPB users can tell
  within the first few lines that they don't need Node.js. Added a "fastest path"
  default (community `StrydILR` + `StrydLBSSmod`) at the top of the Stryd custom-field
  setup section.
- **README "Race report" section renamed** (was "Background", which collided with the
  separate `BACKGROUND.md` design-philosophy doc linked from the Documentation list).
- **`PUBLIC_MANIFEST.md`**: corrected the stale tool count (18 → 23) and its increment
  notes; updated the `docs/images/dual_pmc.jpg` INCLUDE entry's version tag.

No source code or test changes in this release.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-11

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `include_legacy` param** from `get_weekly_summary` and `get_current_pmc`.
  The `lbss_legacy` key is no longer emitted in tool output.
  To compare against an older or alternative LBSS field ad-hoc, pass `lbss_field` per-call
  (e.g. `lbss_field: "StrydLBSSmod"`).
- **Removed `LBSS_FIELD_LEGACY` env var**. The server no longer reads this variable;
  any existing `.env` entry is silently ignored (Zod unknown-key strip).
  Remove the line from your `.env` and MCPB user_config if present.

### New Features

- **`avg_stride_length_m`** per split and overall in `get_activity_streams_summary`.
  Derived as velocity / (cadence_stream × 2 / 60); uses the run cadence stream (rpm,
  one-foot), verified against Intervals.icu `average_cadence`.

- **`EXTRA_STREAM_FIELDS`** env var — comma-separated Intervals custom stream codes
  (e.g. `StrydLSS,StrydTemp,StrydHumidity`) fetched and surfaced as `extras` per split
  and overall in `get_activity_streams_summary`. Requires custom stream mapping on an
  Intervals.icu activity page (CHARTS → CUSTOM STREAMS → ADD STREAM). Backward-compatible:
  `extras` key is absent when not configured.

- **`run_fraction` + `extras_run`** in `get_activity_streams_summary`.
  `run_fraction`: share of valid samples at or above the run-gate cadence threshold
  (default 70 rpm = 140 spm), per split and overall.
  `extras_run`: extras averages restricted to running samples only, for separating
  per-stride metric change from walk-mix dilution (e.g. StrydLSS stiffness drift vs.
  gait-mix change in ultra-distance races).
  Configurable via `run_gate_cadence_rpm` param (range 40–120).
  Both keys absent when cadence stream is not present (backward-compatible).

- **`run_gate_cadence_rpm`** param in `get_activity_streams_summary` (default 70,
  range 40–120). Echoed in `data_quality.run_gate_cadence_rpm`.

### Internal

- `LBSS_FIELD_LEGACY` / `lbssFieldLegacy` removed from config, tool registry, and
  MCPB `manifest.json` `user_config`.
- `.env.example` reorganized into **Activity custom fields** and **Streams** sections.
- `manifest.json` `user_config`: removed `lbss_field_legacy`, added `extra_stream_fields`.
